# Steel Rumors web design assets

This repository contains stylesheets, template, scripts and other art
assets used for a video tutorial series,
["Building a Hacker News clone in Django"][article]. Hopefully, this
should save your time and be a useful starting point to create your
own customised web designs. Pull request are welcome.

I am not a professional web designer, so please stay calm and enjoy the goodies ;)
